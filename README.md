# Oncodrive3D 

**Oncodrive3D** is a computational method for analyzing patterns of somatic mutations across tumors. It identifies **three-dimensional (3D) clusters** of missense mutations and detects genes under **positive selection**.

## Installation

Install via PyPI:


```bash
pip install oncodrive3d
```

You can obtain the latest code from the repository and install it for development with pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bbglab/oncodrive3d.git
cd oncodrive3d
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .
source .venv/bin/activate
oncodrive3d --help
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you install a modern build tool like [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv),
> you can simply do this:
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/bbglab/clustering_3d.git
> cd clustering_3d
> uv run oncodrive3d --help
> ```

## Building Datasets

This step is required after installation or whenever you need to generate datasets for a different organism or apply a specific threshold to define amino acid contacts.

> [!NOTE]
> The first time that you run Oncodrive3D building dataset step with a given reference genome, it
> will download it from our servers. By default the downloaded datasets go to
> `~/.bgdata`. If you want to move these datasets to another folder you have to
> define the system environment variable `BGDATA_LOCAL` with an export command.

```

## Running 3D-clustering Analysis

For in depth information on how to obtain the required input data and for comprehensive information about the output, please refer to the [Input and Output Documentation](https://github.com/bbglab/oncodrive3d/tree/master/docs/input_output.md).  

### Input

- **Mutations file** (`required`): It can be either:
   - **<input_maf>**: A Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) file annotated with consequences (e.g., by using [Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html)).
   - **<input_vep>**: The unfiltered output of VEP including annotations for all possible transcripts.

- **<mut_profile>** (`optional`): Dictionary including the normalized frequencies of mutations (*values*) in every possible trinucleotide context (*keys*), such as 'ACA>A', 'ACC>A', and so on.

---

> [!NOTE] 
> Examples of the input files are available in the [Test Input Folder](https://github.com/bbglab/oncodrive3d/tree/master/test/input).  
Please refer to these examples to understand the expected format and structure of the input files.

---

---

> [!NOTE]
> Oncodrive3D uses the mutational profile of the cohort to build an accurate background model. However, it’s not strictly required. If the mutational profile is not provided, the tool will use a simple uniform distribution as the background model for simulating mutations and scoring potential 3D clusters.

---

### Main Output

- **\<cohort>.3d_clustering_genes.csv**: A Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file containing the results of the analysis at the gene level. Each row represents a gene, sorted from the most significant to the least significant based on the 3D clustering analysis. The table also includes genes that were not analyzed, with the reason for exclusion provided in the `status` column.
  
- **\<cohort>.3d_clustering_pos.csv**: A Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file containing the results of the analysis at the level of mutated residues. Each row corresponds to a mutated position within a gene and includes detailed information for each mutational cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> To maximize the number of matching transcripts between the input mutations and the AlphaFold predicted structures used by Oncodrive3D, it is recommended to use the unfiltered output of VEP (including all possible transcripts) as input, along with the flags `--o3d_transcripts` `--use_input_symbols` in the `oncodrive3d run` command.

---

### Running With Singularity

```
singularity pull oncodrive3d.sif docker://bbglab/oncodrive3d:latest
singularity exec oncodrive3d.sif oncodrive3d run -i <input_maf> -p <mut_profile> \ 
                                                 -d <build_folder> -C <cohort_name>
```


### Testing

To verify that Oncodrive3D is installed and configured correctly, you can perform a test run using the provided test input files: 

```
oncodrive3d run -d <build_folder> \
                -i ./test/input/maf/TCGA_WXS_ACC.in.maf \ 
                -p ./test/input/mut_profile/TCGA_WXS_ACC.sig.json \
                -o ./test/output/ -C TCGA_WXS_ACC
```

Check the output in the `test/output/` directory to ensure the analysis completes successfully.

The provided input files also serve as examples to demonstrate the expected structure and format of the input files. Users can refer to these files when preparing their own input data for analysis.


## Parallel Processing on Multiple Cohorts

Oncodrive3D can be run in parallel on multiple cohorts using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/). This approach enables efficient, reproducible and scalable analysis across datasets.

### Requirements

1. Install [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html) (version `23.04.3` was used for testing).
2. Install either or both:
   - [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/installation.html)
   - [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)


#### Option 1: Using Singularity

Pull the Oncodrive3D Singularity images from Docker Hub.

```
singularity pull oncodrive3d.sif docker://bbglab/oncodrive3d:latest
```

#### Option 2: Using Conda

Ensure Oncodrive3D is installed in your Conda environment and update the `params` section of the `nextflow.config` file to point to your Conda installation:

```groovy
params {
    ...
    conda_env = '/path/to/conda/environment/with/oncodrive3d' 
    ...
}
```

Replace `/path/to/conda/environment/with/oncodrive3d` with the path to your Conda environment. Alternatively, you can provide it as a command-line argument.

### Test Run

Run a test to ensure that everything is set up correctly and functioning as expected:

```
cd oncodrive3d_pipeline
nextflow run main.nf -profile test,container --data_dir <build_folder>
```

Replace `<build_folder>` with the path to the Oncodrive3D datasets built in the [building datasets](#building-datasets) step.
If you prefer to use Conda, replace `container` in the `-profile` argument with `conda`.

### Usage

---

> [!WARNING]
> When using the Nextflow script, ensure that your input files are organized in the following directory structure:
> 
> ```plaintext
> input/
>   ├── maf/
>   │   └── <cohort>.in.maf
>   ├── vep/
>   │   └── <cohort>.vep.tsv.gz
>   └── mut_profile/
>       └── <cohort>.sig.json
> ```
> 
> - `maf/`: Contains mutation files with the `.in.maf` extension.
> - `vep/`: Contains VEP annotation files with the `.vep.tsv.gz` extension, which include annotated mutations with all possible transcripts.
> - `mut_profile/`: Contains mutational profile files with the `.sig.json` extension.
